# Advent of code 2023

A series of small programming exercises inspired by [Advent calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar).

Each project aims to be a small, but usable and pratical exercise.

1. [Scrape Hacker News](01-scrape-hacker-news/README.md): A minimalistic scraper in Go of [news.ycombinator.com](https://news.ycombinator.com).
2. [Deploy our scraper as lambda to AWS](02-scrape-in-cloud/README.md): It is time to deploy our mighty scraper to production.
3. [Add notifications to our scraper](03-scrape-with-notifications/README.md): The scraper worked well, it's time to add notifications.
4. [Badge on my Rapsberry PI](03-badger-2040/README.md): Ventured into hardware and created custom badge for conference.
5. [Generate sample data in SQL using LLM](05-sample-sql-data/README.md): Time for AI. LLM that will generate sample data in SQL.
